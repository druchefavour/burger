## Eat-Da-Burger! APP

# Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
# Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
# Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
# The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
# In this app, a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM is created.
# The app follows the MVC design pattern; Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

## Procedure
# Make a package.json file by running npm init from the command line.
# Install the Express npm package: npm install express --save.
# Create a server.js file.
